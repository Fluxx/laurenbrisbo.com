      <h1>Hi, <span>Ridejoy!</span>!</h1>

      <p>My name is <strong>Lauren</strong> and I'm very interested in the Public Relations Specialist position at your company. I love the community&hyphen;driven ridesharing concept of <strong>Ridejoy</strong> and the ethos of the company itself. I want to tell the world how completely amazing the service is!</p>

      <p>Luckily, this just so happens to be what I do for a living. <em>Seriously</em>&mdash;it's an awesome gig.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>First, a little bit about my professional background</h2>

    <p class="first">I have about five years of agency experience working on communications campaigns that focused on health, environment, and transportation issues. In other words, non soul&hyphen;sucking stuff that I personally believe in. This is important to me. I like to sleep at night.</p>

    <p>I worked on a small public relations team where I was able to tackle a range of tasks on a daily basis&mdash;from identifying outreach strategies and pitching media to drafting press releases and staffing press events. No job was too big or too small, since we were all in it together.</p>

    <h2>A few of my transportation and environmental clients include</h2>

    <ul id="clients">
      <li><a href="http://metro.kingcounty.gov/"><img src="images/kcmetro_logo.png"></a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/"><img src="images/wsdot_logo.jpg"></a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.energystar.gov/"><img src="images/energy_star_logo.jpg"></a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.cleanairpartners.net/"><img src="images/clean_air_partners_logo.jpg"></a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.commuteseattle.com/"><img src="images/commute_seattle_logo.jpg"></a></li>
     </ul>

    <p class="emphasized first">Ridejoy is definitely a something I can get behind. I believe in collaborative consumption, reducing our environmental impact, and doing good in general.</p>

    <h2>I have done a lot of pitching.  Lots.</h2>

    <p class="first">A big part of my job was of course, pitching! Here's a few of the outlets I've placed stories in for clients.</p>

    <ul id="pitching">

    </ul>

    <h2>Now, please allow me to rehash</h2>

    <p class="first">Why I think I'd be a good fit at Ridejoy:</p>

    <ul id="fit">
      <li>I have experience working on a range of transportation programs, with an emphasis on ride sharing and mass transportation</li>
      <li>I love to wear a lot of hats and thrive in an environment where I can grow and evolve. No one trick pony here.</li>
      <li>I've got a soul. I am passionate about the environment and believe that the RideJoy model can reduce the number of single occupant vehicles on the road while helping people get to where they need to go. Win&hyphen;win in my book!</li>
    </ul>
